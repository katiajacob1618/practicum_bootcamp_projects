# 4th Project for Practicum Bootcamp
## Analysis of video games sales
### Description:

The goal is to conduct an exploratory and statistical analysis for an online worldwide video games store on data going back to 2016, to plan a campaign for 2017 and identify patterns in the data. We'll look at things like the number of games released each year and the sales for each platform over the years and decide over which period to do the analysis as earlier years are not as relevant for today's world. We will also look at how reviews, whether from users or critics, affect the total sales, and also which genres sell the most, as well as the top 5 performing genres and platforms for each region, and the impact of ESRB ratings on sales of each region. There are also a couple of hypothesis tests at the end.
